Bfrx API example.

An example showing four types of sound generation.

	1: synthesized on the fly
	2: precached
	3: mutated on the fly
	4: precached mutations

For realtime applications, I *strongly* recommend precaching :)

And yes, you'll need a different Bfxr instance for each sound.

One other note: 
	- Synthesis is substantially slower in debug mode than final release 
	  builds, so don't get too down if it makes things a bit laggy while 
	  testing.
	- The caching API in this version is synchronous.  This means that 
	  the program can't do anything while caching sounds.  
	- Mixes take longer to generate than plain 'ol synths, so they can
	  take substantially longer to generation mutations for.
